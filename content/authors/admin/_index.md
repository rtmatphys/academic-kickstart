I am a project researcher at Center for Quantum Information and Quantum Biology (QIQB), Osaka University. My current interest lies in development of near-term quantum algorithms for solving quantum many-body problems. I have research experience in condensed matter physics, such as computational studies of correlated electron systems as well as experimental studies of topological materials.
